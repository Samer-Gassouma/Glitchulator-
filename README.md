# Enterprise Glitchulator™ 

A massively over-engineered calculator that turns simple arithmetic into an enterprise-grade catastrophe. Because sometimes you need a factory factory factory pattern just to add 2+2.

# Features

- **Over-Engineered Architecture**: Each arithmetic operation is its own microservice with 17 layers of abstraction
- **Enterprise-Grade Logging**: Every button press is logged with full stack traces and DNA sequencing
- **Musical Visualization**: Converts calculations into musical notes because why not
- **DNA/RNA Visualization**: Represents numbers in genetic code, obviously essential for addition
- **Reality-Bending Alarm System**: Sets alarms that slowly corrupt the space-time continuum
- **Temporal Anomaly Detection**: Warns users about timeline corruption during calculations

## Technical 

### Core Components

- **Enterprise Calculator**: The main calculator interface with quantum uncertainty built-in
- **Musical Sheet**: Converts calculations into musical sequences
- **DNA Visualizer**: Represents operations as DNA/RNA strands
- **Enterprise Alarm**: A simple alarm that definitely won't destroy reality

### Design Patterns Used (Way Too Many)

1. Factory Factory Factory Pattern
2. Abstract Factory Pattern
3. Builder Pattern
4. Singleton Pattern (because one instance wasn't complex enough)
5. Observer Pattern (to watch the system implode)
